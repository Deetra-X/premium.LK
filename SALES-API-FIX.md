# Sales API Fix: Testing Guide

## What I've Fixed

1. The main issue with the sales endpoints was that the route ordering in Express.js wasn't correct.
2. The specific `/stats` route was defined after the parameterized `/:id` route, causing `/stats` to be interpreted as an ID.
3. I've rewritten the sales router in `backend/routes/sales.js` to fix the order, putting specific routes before parameterized routes.
4. I've also created a standalone test server in `final-test-server.js` to demonstrate the correct route ordering.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
Your main application continues to run on port 3001. Only the standalone test server runs on a different port (3005). No port changes were made to your actual application.

## Testing Steps

### Option 1: Test with the Standalone Server

1. Open a terminal in VS Code or PowerShell
2. Navigate to your project directory
3. Run the standalone test server:
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\Deenath Damsinghe\Downloads\POS-main"
   node final-test-server.js
   ```
4. Test the endpoints with these commands in a new terminal window:
   ```powershell
   # Test root endpoint
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3005/api/sales" -Method GET | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content
   
   # Test stats endpoint - THIS SHOULD NOW WORK!
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3005/api/sales/stats" -Method GET | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content
   
   # Test ID endpoint
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3005/api/sales/123" -Method GET | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content
   ```

### Option 2: Test with Your Main Server

1. Start your main server:
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\Deenath Damsinghe\Downloads\POS-main"
   npm run server  # Or your appropriate start command
   ```

2. Test the endpoints with these commands in a new terminal window:
   ```powershell
   # Test root endpoint
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/sales" -Method GET | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content
   
   # Test stats endpoint - THIS SHOULD NOW WORK!
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/sales/stats" -Method GET | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content
   
   # Test ID endpoint
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/sales/123" -Method GET | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content
   ```

## What I Changed in Your Code

1. In `backend/routes/sales.js`:
   - Reordered routes to put specific routes first
   - Added comments explaining the route ordering
   - Added logging to help with debugging
   
2. Created `final-test-server.js`:
   - A simplified Express server with the routes in the correct order
   - Runs on port 3005 to avoid conflicts with your main server
   - Demonstrates the proper route ordering

## The Key Fix

```javascript
// The order matters!

// 1. Root route
router.get('/', (req, res) => { /* ... */ });

// 2. Specific routes (must come BEFORE parameterized routes)
router.get('/stats', (req, res) => { /* ... */ });

// 3. Parameterized routes (must come AFTER specific routes)
router.get('/:id', (req, res) => { /* ... */ });
```

## Common Express.js Routing Issue

This is a common issue in Express.js applications. The framework processes routes in the order they are defined. If a parameterized route like `/:id` is defined before a specific route like `/stats`, Express will interpret `/stats` as an ID parameter and route it to the `/:id` handler.
